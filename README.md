# x_distill

> Project description goes here.

## Setup

For setup, you need to do the following things:


1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/candemircan/x_distill.git
    ```

2. Install the local packages
    ```bash
    cd x_distill
    pip install .
    ```

3. Define environment variables.
    You need to define `X_DISTILL_DIR` as an environment variable, so that the code can find the relevant data and files. You can do this by running the following lines in your terminal:

    ```bash
    export X_DISTILL_DIR=/PATH/TO/X_DISTILL
    ```

    or put the same lines in a file that is run during your session startup (e.g. `~/.bashrc`)

    Note: I am using Python 3.11, not sure about the compatability with other versions.
